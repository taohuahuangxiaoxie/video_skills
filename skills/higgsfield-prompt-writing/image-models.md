## Routing by Asset Class

`[FIELD — AI-vs-VFX, 2026-08-08]` There is no single best image model for a project —
there is a best model **per asset class**, and switching between them mid-project is the
normal case. This table is the routing; the per-model sections below are the reference.

| Asset class | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Human character sheet, face matching | **Nano Banana 2** | Strongest face match on the platform |
| Small corrective edits to an existing asset | **Nano Banana 2** | Holds its input images best — switch *to* it for a one-line fix instead of re-prompting the whole sheet |
| Fantasy creature / non-human character sheet | **Seedream 5.0** | Best at fantasy creatures |
| Clothing, wardrobe changes, branded garments | **GPT Image 2** | Handles clothing best |
| Locations and environment stills | **Soul Cinema** | Most cinematic frames; GPT skews yellow, Nano Banana makes locations too clean and too symmetrical |

Two economics notes that follow from it:

- **Location work batches.** Seven credits buys one GPT Image 2 generation or ~56 Soul
  Cinema variations — so on locations, batch wide and select rather than prompt-tuning.
  Select on **light**: bad light in the still is the most common cause of a slop video.
- **Fix, don't rebuild.** A warped logo or a colour cast on an otherwise-good sheet is a
  Nano Banana 2 one-liner (`change the logo to the one in image two`). Re-prompting the
  sheet re-rolls everything that was already right.

Sheet-construction laws (grey background, the two-close-up creature sheet, the face-lock
crop, the size-ref frame) live in `skills/higgsfield-character-design/SKILL.md`

## Seedream Family

### Seedream 5.0 Pro
**Model id:** `seedream_v5_pro` — in the 2026-08-01 spec snapshot (resolution `1k`/`1.5k`/`2k`, default 2k; aspect ratios incl. 21:9). `[FIELD provenance: first observed on 161 harvested community jobs, 2026-07-18]`
**Best for:** Anime / manga / stylized-2D image work — character sheets with clean linework, flat cel color fills, multi-panel manga page layouts with screentones and readable panel geometry
**Field-proven dialects:** split-screen anime character sheets (full-body action pose left, chest-up portrait right, identical character, white seamless background, ~190w median) · black-and-white manga page spreads (panels laid out by position + size + content, refs as Image0/1/2, ink linework, screentones, no color)
**Style anchoring:** use an **art-era anchor** ("early 2000s retro anime, soft painted cel-shading, vintage proportions") — the stylized-image equivalent of the photoreal director/DP anchor
**vs 5.0 Lite / 4.5:** the pick when line + flat color + text/panel layout matter more than photoreal texture; photoreal sheet work stays on Soul / GPT Image 2 / Nano Banana Pro

**Note:** Older model tier — use 4.5 or 5.0 Lite for better results at the same cost

---

## Nano Banana Family (G = Google-powered)

All three models run on Google's Gemini image engine. Each is a distinct model tier.

---

### Nano Banana
**Google model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
**Credits:** 1 per generation
**UI:** Nano Banana · 3:4 · 1/4 · Unlimited · **Draw**
**Best for:** Sketch-to-image prototyping · portrait format · fast, low-cost generation
**Draw feature:** Sketch a rough composition or shape — model generates from your drawing
**Strengths:** Speed and efficiency, optimized for high-volume, low-latency use
**Note:** Original model — Draw feature makes it still uniquely useful; most other surfaces now default to NB2

---

### Nano Banana Pro
**Google model:** Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview
**Credits:** 2 per generation
**UI:** Nano Banana Pro · 16:9 · 1K · @ (Elements) · Unlimited · **Draw**
**Best for:** Professional asset production · complex multi-element prompts · accurate text in images · brand mockups · sequential art/storyboards
**Draw feature:** Sketch-to-image, same as base
**@ Elements:** Supports @ syntax for Higgsfield saved Elements

**Unique capabilities (not in other Nano Banana tiers):**

**Thinking mode** — Before generating, model silently reasons through complex prompts, producing up to 2 interim "thought images" to test composition. Always on, cannot be disabled. Significantly better at complex, multi-instruction prompts.

**Up to 14 reference images** — Input up to 14 images simultaneously:
- Up to 6 object images (high-fidelity object inclusion)
- Up to 5 person images (character consistency)
Tip: Name each reference's role — "Use Image A for pose, Image B for style, Image C for background"

**Google Search grounding** — Pulls real-time web info for data-accurate visuals: weather forecasts, stock charts, news events. Ask "what's today's weather in Tokyo" and it generates an accurate graphic.

**Advanced text rendering** — Best text accuracy in the family. Multilingual text, infographics, menus, logos, diagrams. Also translates text inside an existing image while preserving layout.

**Resolution:** 1K (default), 2K, 4K
**Aspect ratios:** 1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9

**What it excels at:**
- Text-heavy assets: posters, infographics, magazine covers, menus, diagrams
- Brand identity: logo mockups, pattern draping onto 3D objects/apparel/packaging
- Multi-character scenes: up to 5 consistent characters in a single image
- Sequential art: comic panels, storyboards with consistent characters across panels
- Data visualization with Search grounding: charts/graphs using real-world accuracy
- Product mockups: studio-quality commercial photography shots

**6-element prompt formula for best results:**
1. **Subject** — who/what: "a stoic robot barista with glowing blue optics"
2. **Composition** — framing: "extreme close-up", "low angle", "wide shot"
3. **Action** — what's happening: "brewing coffee, steam rising"
4. **Location** — setting: "a futuristic café on Mars, warm amber lighting"
5. **Style** — aesthetic: "photorealistic", "3D animation", "film noir", "watercolor"
6. **Camera/lighting** — "shallow depth of field (f/1.8)", "golden hour backlight", "muted teal color grading"

**When using multiple reference images:** explicitly name each reference's role in the prompt

**Known limitations (official):**
- Small text and fine details may not render perfectly every time
- Factual data in diagrams should be verified — model can hallucinate data
- Multilingual text may have grammar errors
- Complex edits and blending can produce artifacts
- Character consistency may drift across long multi-turn sessions

**Production-team observations (Higgsfield team disclosed):**

The following failure modes and counters come from the Hell Grind 90-min Cannes production team's documented in-pipeline use of Nano Banana Pro. They sit alongside the official limitations above — recurring patterns the team hit and the prompt-side fixes they shipped.

- **Plasticky-texture failure mode.** Surfaces are smooth and over-rendered; faces read as plastic in wide shots. Counter: append a trailing line `light atmospheric haze, film grain, crush blacks, shadow depth` at the end of the prompt. The single trailing line measurably shifts texture toward photographic without destabilizing the rest of the composition.
- **Spatial-awareness limit (location references).** Uploading a city or environment image as a reference results in indoor subjects placed outdoors, or interiors that fail to spatially align with the reference geometry. Counter: keep the location in the *prompt text* (described verbally), not as an *image reference*. NBP handles described locations better than image-referenced ones.
- **4-view default vs single composition.** NBP defaults to producing a 4-view reference sheet when asked for a character. Counter: explicitly request `one view image` (or `single composition`) when you want a single hero frame rather than a sheet.
- **Multi-image embedded prompt drift.** A single prompt requiring many embedded reference elements (e.g., a 12-Polaroid photo wall built from individual character sheets) produces severe drift — faces from the source sheets fail to read correctly in the composite. Counter: generate each element individually, then composite in Photoshop. The production-team workflow accepted this trade-off (longer post-production for higher per-element fidelity).

**Location-handling discipline (Group H):**

When NBP is generating location-anchored shots, three patterns recur in production-team practice:

- **Every location needs an anchor** — a named visual landmark (a tree, a specific architectural feature, a recurring prop) gives the prompt a fixed point for relative spatial placement (`Roco stands to the left of the tree`). Anchorless locations drift.
- **Never generate locations from the front.** Front-facing location renders confuse NBP's depth perception. Use a 3/4 angle or a ceiling-corner (CCTV) angle for location-establishing shots.
- **Split locations into views, don't combine.** When a location appears across multiple cuts at different angles, generate separate location images per angle and attach them as separate references (`for cut one use this view, for cut two use this view`). Production-team learning evolved this away from earlier combined-into-single-reference practice — separate references hold better.

**Workflow positioning:**

NBP is the strongest single image model on the platform for sharpness, multi-element composition, and text rendering. For **high-investment characters** that will appear across many shots, the two-tool pipeline outperforms NBP alone: Soul Cinema for initial character generation + GPT Image 2 for refinement editing. See `skills/higgsfield-soul/SKILL.md` § Two-Tool Refinement Pipeline for the split-by-task discipline and the ~600 + ~200 = ~800 generations anchor from the Hell Grind production.

### Nano Banana 2
**Google model:** Gemini 3.1 Flash Image
**Released:** February 26, 2026
**Credits:** 1.5 per generation
**UI:** Nano Banana 2 · 16:9 · 1K · 1/4
**Best for:** Pro-quality output at Flash speed · rapid iteration on complex prompts · character-consistent multi-image workflows · text rendering · storyboarding

**What it is:** Google's "best of both worlds" — Nano Banana Pro's intelligence at Nano Banana's speed. Now the default image model across most Google surfaces (Gemini app, Search, Flow, Google Ads). Also powers **Soul Cast** in Cinema Studio 2.5.

**Capabilities:**
- **Subject consistency**: maintains resemblance of up to **5 characters** and fidelity of up to **14 objects** in a single workflow — critical for storyboarding
- **Precision text rendering + translation**: accurate legible text in images, can translate/localize text within an image while preserving layout
- **Advanced world knowledge**: pulls from Gemini's knowledge base + real-time web search to accurately render specific subjects, places, landmarks
- **Resolution**: 512px to 4K native
- **Aspect ratios**: 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, 3:2, 2:3, 4:5, 5:4, 21:9
- **Infographics, diagrams, data visualizations**: strong at generating from text prompts
- **Reference image editing**: edit/transform/combine existing images via text prompts
- **Style transfer**: combine multiple reference images into one output
- **Photorealistic quality**: vibrant lighting, richer textures, sharper details vs original Nano Banana

**Prompting patterns that work well:**
- **Structured JSON prompts** for complex scenes (subject → accessories → photography → background breakdown)
- **Short direct prompts** also work ("Create a realistic photo of this character")
- **Style transfer**: "Show me the animation style image version" / "Show me the real-life photo version"
- **Location + time**: coordinates or place name + "at sunset" generates accurate scenes
- **Blueprint/schematic**: "hand drawn isometric schematic diagram of [subject]"
- **Infographic overlays**: detailed annotation instructions on top of photos
- **Multi-panel comics**: single prompt with per-panel descriptions
- **Product ad recreation**: "Recreate this ad concept using my product instead" + reference image

**When to use NB2 vs Pro:**
- **NB2** = best for rapid generation, precise instruction following, speed, integrated image-search grounding
- **NB Pro** = best for high-fidelity tasks requiring maximum factual accuracy, complex compositions, Thinking mode reasoning, 14-ref compositing

**When to use NB2 vs base Nano Banana:**
- NB2 is dramatically better at everything — base is only worth using for its Draw feature

**No Draw yet** — Draw feature exists only in base Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro

**SynthID + C2PA:** All Nano Banana family outputs include an invisible SynthID watermark and C2PA Content Credentials for AI provenance verification

---

---

## Recraft Family (⚠ External/Third-party)

### Recraft 4.1
**Model id:** `recraft_v4_1` (renamed from `recraft-v4-1`, which remains a catalog alias) · **Provider:** Recraft
**UI:** Recraft V4.1 (and **Recraft V4.1 Utility**) · 1:1 · 1/4 · NEW
**Best for:** Photorealistic + expressive generation, brand assets, logos/icons, product mockups
**Resolution:** 1k (everyday) / 2k (larger assets) — see `specs/image-model-specs.yaml`
**Batch:** 1–4 images per job (`batch_size`)
**Unique control — `model_type` (4 variants):**
- `standard` — expressive, exploratory generation (the default; "Recraft V4.1" in the UI)
- `vector` — logos, typography, icons, SVG-like illustration
- `utility` — cleaner, flatter, front-facing, predictable product shots & mockups (the **"Recraft V4.1 Utility"** UI entry)
- `utility_vector` — utility simplicity with vector output (brand assets)

**Palette control:** `colors` (up to 10 `#RRGGBB` values) and `background_color` (single `#RRGGBB` or null) — strong fit for brand swatches, controlled flat backgrounds, icon/vector work. Hex only: no `#RGB` shorthand, no `#RRGGBBAA`, no `rgba()`, no color names.
**Prompt tip:** For logos/icons pick `vector`; for clean e-commerce product shots pick `utility`. Pass brand colors via `colors` rather than describing them in prose.

---

## Swap Tools (Not Generation Models)

These are upload-based transformation tools, not text-to-image generators.

### Face Swap
**Credits:** Free (2 free generations, then paid)
**UI:** Face Swap · Your Photo (upload face to insert) · Target Image (photo with face to replace) · 3:4 · Unlimited
**How it works:** Upload the face you want → upload the target photo → face is composited in

### Character Swap
**Credits:** 2 per generation
**UI:** Character Swap · Your Photo (character to insert) · Target Image (character to replace) · 3:4
**How it works:** Full character body swap — replaces an entire person in a target image with your uploaded character
**vs Face Swap:** Face Swap = face only. Character Swap = full body/character replacement.

> The image catalog also carries utility/system entries — AutoSprite (animate a character image into a game-ready sprite sheet), MS Image (Marketing Studio ad images), image_auto (auto model selection), upscalers (Topaz, Bytedance), background remover, and outpaint. These are pipeline tools rather than prompt-crafted generation models and are out of scope for this reference.
