# Higgsfield Audio Prompting Guide

## QUICK FACTS
*Routing aids — read the linked sections for the full rules.*
- Native-joint audio models: Kling 3.0, Seedance 2.0 / 1.5 Pro, Veo 3/3.1, Grok — all others add audio in post [→](#which-models-support-audio)
- Four layers to consider per prompt: Dialogue / SFX / Ambient / BGM [→](#the-four-audio-layers)
- Lip-sync is the most failure-prone feature: 3–8s clips, MCU framing, one speaking face, locked camera, no head-motion tokens; per-language sync-word budgets are FIELD-reported [→](#lip-sync-rules)
- **Seedance 2.0 `@Audio1` is a conditioning INPUT** — beat sync, the `[AUDIO: Xs]` script block, and the first-15s extraction trap [→](#audio-as-a-conditioning-input-seedance-20-audio1)
- Scope an audio reference like an image one: name the property that rides, the property that must NOT, and where the excluded one comes from instead [→](#scope-an-audio-reference-say-which-property-rides)
- Multi-clip assembly: one master track · cuts land on musical punctuation, never inside a sung vowel (ECU mouth-match is the one exception) · unified grain + LUT masks batch color drift [→](#cutting-to-music-assembling-separately-generated-clips-on-one-track)
- Cinema Studio 3.0 native joint audio (SCELA): describe audio as a separate section; specific foley beats generic moods [→](#cinema-studio-30-audio-businessteam-plan)
- **Seed Audio 1.0** (`seed_audio`, standalone) = whole-scene audio in ONE pass — multi-speaker dialogue + music + SFX + ambience mixed [→](#scene-audio-generation-seed-audio-10)
- Standalone Audio catalog (2026-08-01 snapshot): `seed_audio`, `qwen_audio_tts` (NEW — Qwen 3.0 TTS Flash, expressive instructions + cloned voices), `text2speech_v2` (5 engines incl. cozy_voice), plus 3 game-pipeline-only tools — distinct from in-video joint audio [→](#standalone-audio-tab-tool-catalog-2026-08-01-snapshot)

## Which Models Support Audio?

| Model | Audio type | Dialogue | SFX | Ambient | BGM | Lip-sync |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----|---------|-----|----------|
| Kling 3.0 / Omni | Native joint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Multi-language |
| Seedance 2.0 | Native joint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Multi-language |
| Seedance 1.5 Pro | Native joint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Best lip-sync |
| Veo 3 / 3.1 | Native joint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ English best |
| Grok Imagine Video | Native joint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| All other models | ❌ | — | — | — | — | — |

**"Native joint"** means audio and video are generated simultaneously in one pass —
not layered on after. This produces natural synchronization without post-production.

Models without native audio: add audio in post with Lipsync Studio or external tools.

## The Four Audio Layers

Every audio-capable prompt should consider four layers. You don't need all four
in every prompt, but knowing which to include gives the model clear direction.

### 1. Dialogue — What characters say

Put dialogue in quotes. Be explicit about who speaks, their tone, and language.

```
She says: "We need to leave. Now."
He whispers: "Not yet."
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep dialogue short — 1-2 sentences per character per shot
- Specify emotional tone: "says urgently", "whispers", "shouts across the room"
- For non-English: specify language and dialect → `She speaks in Cantonese: "走啦"`
- For Seedance 1.5 Pro: supports English, Chinese (incl. Sichuanese, Cantonese,
  Taiwanese Mandarin, Shanghainese), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Indonesian

### 2. SFX — Specific sound events tied to action

Describe SFX at the point they happen. Tie them to visible actions.

```
The glass shatters on the floor — sharp crack, then settling tinkle.
Footsteps on wet concrete — splashing, rhythmic.
A door slams shut — heavy metal, echoing.
```

**Best practices:**
- One SFX description per action beat
- Use onomatopoeia sparingly — descriptive phrases work better than "BANG" or "CRASH"
- Tie timing to action: "as she sets the cup down" not "cup sound at 4 seconds"

### 3. Ambient — Background soundscape

Set the acoustic environment. This is the continuous sound bed.

```
Ambient: quiet café murmur, espresso machine, rain against windows.
Ambient: forest at night — crickets, distant owl, gentle wind through leaves.
Ambient: busy intersection — traffic, horns, construction in the distance.
```

**Best practices:**
- 2-3 ambient elements maximum — more gets muddy
- Describe the *space* acoustics: "reverberant church hall", "tight car interior"
- Contrast silence with sound for impact: "Dead silence. Then — a single footstep."

### 4. BGM — Background music mood

Don't name songs or artists (content filter). Describe the musical texture.

```
BGM: slow piano, minor key, melancholic.
BGM: tense orchestral build — low strings, rising.
BGM: lo-fi hip-hop beat, warm vinyl crackle, relaxed.
```

**Best practices:**
- Describe instrumentation, tempo, mood — not genre labels alone
- "Tense strings, building" works better than "suspenseful music"
- Specify when music enters/exits: "Piano enters at the midpoint, builds to the end"
- For beat-sync content: "Cuts match the downbeat" or "Movement peaks on the drop"

### Suppressing music — `NO BGM` is a spec, `no music` is a preference

`[DEMO — Joey cinema-director-v3, 2026-08-16]` `[UNPROVEN HERE]` When a piece must
carry no score, the phrase matters. **`no music` reads as a weak stylistic preference**
and loses to the model's strong prior that generated video wants a bed under it.
**`NO BGM` reads as a production term** — a hard spec — and is the form to write.
Expand it once on first use so the abbreviation is unambiguous, then let it carry.

**Lead positive, then negate.** Name what the audio *is* before naming what it is not —
diegetic sources tied to surfaces and materials, plus room tone. A suppression clause
with nothing positive in it leaves the model to decide what "silence" sounds like, and
it decides in favour of a pad.

```
Audio: diegetic sound only — footsteps on wet stone, fabric shift, breath, room tone.
NO BGM — no background music of any kind. No score, no soundtrack, no instrumental,
no underscore, no ambient musical pad, no drone, no tone bed. Nothing musical at any point.
```

**Promote it to the top on a scene that must land silent.** Audio instructions carry
more weight early; by the time the model reaches a closing audio block it has already
decided what the piece sounds like. State `NO BGM` in the header alongside shot count
and cut policy, then restate it as the closing audio clause.

> **Enumerate with care — this cuts against the house rule on negation.**
> `../shared/negative-constraints.md` and the repo's staging-reference doctrine both
> hold that **naming a thing under a negation ships the token anyway** and can prime
> the very output you are refusing. The source's long list (score, soundtrack,
> instrumental, underscore, ambient pad, drone, tone bed, swell, sting, humming,
> whistling, lyrics) is its answer to a real failure — a bare negation lets the model
> supply an "ambient texture" and consider the instruction honoured — but it is one
> practitioner's fix and is **not measured here**. Default to the short form above;
> reach for the full enumeration only when a short form has already failed on the
> shot in front of you, and expect the enumeration itself to carry some priming risk.

**Attached-track lock.** When an audio or video track is attached it is the sole and
complete audio source, and it owns all internal timing — never impose per-beat timing
on a lipsync take:

```
AUDIO: the attached clip @Video 1 is the sole and complete audio source for this
sequence. Generate no additional audio of any kind — no room tone, no foley, no
ambience, no breath, no added dialogue, NO BGM.
```

**The unheard-track technique** lets bodies perform to music that is not in the mix —
useful when the score is added in post: state that the track is inaudible, then describe
the performance against it (*"singing roughly in time to the unheard 87 BPM beat"*),
plus the diegetic layer that IS heard.

---

## Audio Prompt Structure

Add audio cues naturally within your prompt or as a dedicated block at the end.

### Inline method (preferred for short prompts):

```
A woman walks into a quiet library. Her heels click on the marble floor — each step
echoing. She whispers to the librarian: "Do you have the Collected Letters?"
Distant page turns. A clock ticks somewhere above.
```

### Dedicated block method (better for complex audio):

```
[Scene description — visual content, action, camera]

Audio:
  Dialogue: She says "We leave at dawn." He replies: "I'll be ready."
  SFX: coffee cup set down, chair scraping back
  Ambient: early morning kitchen — birds outside, kettle just boiled
  BGM: none — silence emphasizes the tension
```

---

## Lip-Sync Rules

Lip-sync is the most failure-prone audio feature. Follow these rules strictly:

> **Expressive facial acting *around* the words** — forced smiles, leaking fear,
> mixed emotions during a spoken line — is driven separately by FACS Action Unit
> codes per beat. Let lip-sync shape the phonemes; schedule the brow/eye/cheek
> AUs for the performance. See `../higgsfield-facs/SKILL.md` § Dialogue &
> Monologue Facial Acting.

### Do:
- Keep dialogue clips 3–8 seconds (sweet spot for accuracy)
- Use medium close-up or closer framing — model needs to see the mouth clearly
- One speaking face per shot — multiple faces break audio routing
- Lock the camera: `locked-off static camera` or `slow Dolly In` only
- Remove all head/face motion tokens: `nodding`, `turning head`, `looking around`
  compete with the lip engine and cause desync

### Don't:
- Don't combine dialogue with vigorous head movement in the same prompt
- Don't use 15s clips for lip-sync — technical max but accuracy degrades past 8s
- Don't include ambient or music tokens if lip-sync is the priority — they invite
  the generative audio engine to override your dialogue
- Don't use non-MP3 audio for Seedance 2.0 (when available) — WAV/AAC/OGG fail silently

### Multi-character dialogue workaround:
Multi-person lip-sync matching is an unresolved limitation across all models.
The production workaround:
1. Generate each character separately with their own audio segment
2. Composite in CapCut/Premiere using picture-in-picture + linear mask (15% feather)
3. Static image for the listening character; generated video for the speaking character

### Per-language dialogue-sync budgets [FIELD — community, seedance-2.0 repo v6.6.0]

Field-observed word budgets for **reliable lip-sync** in a ~15s in-video Seedance
dialogue clip — not official limits, and not the same as how many words the model
can *voice*. The **acoustic budget ≠ reliable-sync budget**: the model will happily
speak more words than it can keep synced to the mouth.

| Language | Reliable-sync budget (~15s clip) | Notes |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------|
| English | ~16–20 words (5–10 per line) | Strongest Western language |
| Mandarin | — | Strongest sync overall |
| Russian | ~10–15 words | Weak — budget conservatively |
| Japanese / Korean | Under-tested | No reliable field numbers yet |

Cross-language sizing unit: **"one short sentence ≈ one breath."** Write dialogue
in breath-sized sentences and count breaths, not seconds.

### Voice-reference lip-sync path [FIELD — community, seedance-2.0 repo v6.6.0]

On surfaces that accept a spoken-voice reference, an attached **rights-cleared
voice recording drives lip-sync directly** — the model syncs the mouth to your
recording instead of synthesizing a voice first. This is the most reliable
field-reported path for **non-English dialogue** (it sidesteps the weak-language
sync budgets above). **Rights-sensitive:** only use recordings you have clear
rights to — cloned or scraped voices are out.

---

## Audio as a Conditioning Input — Seedance 2.0 (`@Audio1`)

The most under-used Seedance 2.0 capability: an uploaded audio file is a
**conditioning input**, not just an output track. The model spec lists `audio`
as a reference media role alongside `image` / `video`, and `generate_audio`
(native sound output) is documented as *independent of the audio reference
medias* — i.e. the uploaded file conditions the **generation**, and whether the
clip also gets generated sound is a separate switch.

This means `@Audio1` has **two distinct jobs**, and you pick one per shot:

| Use | What `@Audio1` does | Prompt discipline |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Audio-as-output** | Plays the uploaded track unmodified as the clip's soundtrack | Timestamp-anchor it (`plays exactly as uploaded from 0s to end`) and **remove** all ambient/SFX/music tokens so the engine doesn't override it (see § Seedance 2.0 below) |
| **Audio-as-driver (beat sync)** | Drives the **visuals** — cut timing, camera acceleration, action pace, energy peaks | Write the audio→visual mapping explicitly (below). The clip can still get generated sound, or set `generate_audio` false for visuals-only. |
| **Audio-as-performance** | The character on screen **performs** the track — hums, sings, plays along, moves to it — hitting the actual notes | Scope it to the one property you want (§ Scope an audio reference, below). Unscoped, it also lends its voice. |

> **Why it works (author's model — empirical, not in the official spec):** the
> temporal branch that reasons about motion and pacing reads the sound's
> structure — beat positions, dynamic contour, timbral texture, song-structure
> sections — and maps it to visual rhythm. Treat the mechanism as a working
> model; treat the capability (audio reference role) as confirmed.

### Scope an audio reference — say which property rides

Every *image* reference in this stack is scoped in both directions: what it
locks, and what must be read past ("ignore the sheet's grey background", "not
its camera vantage"). **Audio references have had no equivalent vocabulary, and
they need one for the same reason** — a sound file carries several properties
at once, and an unscoped reference lends all of them.

The case that shows it [DEMO — Higgsfield "AI Love Stories" tutorial, 2026-08]:
a character had to hum a specific tune on camera. Without a reference the model
**invented a different melody every take** — the reported result of the
no-reference control was a performance that was off-key with no rhythm. With a
voice memo of the tune attached, it hit the notes on the first take.

But the memo was somebody else's voice, and the character has his own. So the
reference was **scoped in prose**:

```
@Audio1 is the reference for the HUMMED LINE only. Take from it ONLY the
melody: the exact notes, pitches and intervals, the tempo, the phrasing and
the rhythmic pause — note for note, beat for beat, nothing improvised. Do NOT
copy the voice, timbre or vocal identity heard in the recording — he hums in
his OWN natural speaking voice, the same voice he speaks his lines with. All
spoken dialogue is performed as scripted below, not taken from any audio.
```

**The pattern, generalised — three parts, and the third is the one that gets
skipped:**

1. **Name the property that rides**, as narrowly as you can: notes, pitches and
   intervals; tempo and phrasing; the rhythmic pause. Not "the song".
2. **Name what must NOT ride**, explicitly: voice, timbre, vocal identity.
   Sound files carry a performer as well as a performance.
3. **Say where the excluded property comes from instead** — "his own natural
   speaking voice, the same one he speaks his lines with". A reference that is
   only told what not to do leaves the model to pick, and it will pick the
   reference.

The same three-part shape works for other audio properties:

| Riding | Excluded | Sourced instead from |
|---|---|---|
| melody, tempo, phrasing | voice, timbre, identity | the character's own speaking voice |
| rhythm and accent pattern | instrumentation, key | the scene's own diegetic sound |
| emotional contour, dynamics | the words | the scripted dialogue |

**Scope note.** Whether a reference track becomes the spoken output differs by
model line — see § Audio by Model. The scoping vocabulary above is about which
*property* transfers, and is written to be read alongside whatever that line
does with an attached track, not instead of it.

**Rights:** the memo above was recorded by the person for this purpose. Same
constraint as the voice-reference lip-sync path — use recordings you have clear
rights to.

[UNPROVEN HERE] — one production, one property (melody). The *mechanism* is
already confirmed (audio is a reference media role); what is unproven here is
how far prose scoping steers it. Cheap to test on any tune you own.

### Beat sync — the audio choreographs the visuals

Upload an MP3 as `@Audio1`, then map audio characteristics to visual elements.
The minimum is three sentences, each handling one thing — **rhythm source /
which visual responds / how energy maps to the arc**:

```
Use @Audio1 as the rhythmic foundation. Sync camera transitions to the beat
positions. Visual energy builds with the audio crescendo and peaks at the drop.
```

You can assign **different visual elements to different audio characteristics** —
mixing audio-to-visual the way you'd mix a track:

```
@Audio1 drives the visual rhythm. Camera cuts land on the downbeats. Subject
movement accelerates into the build, holds at the peak, releases on the drop.
Colour temperature shifts warmer with the crescendo.
```

Camera ← beat position. Movement ← dynamic contour. Colour ← overall energy arc.

It **stacks with other references** — character from `@Image1`, camera style from
`@Video1`, rhythm from `@Audio1`, processed together:

```
@Image1 as character reference. Follow @Video1 camera-movement style. @Audio1 as
rhythmic foundation — sync all camera transitions to the beat positions.
Character movement should pulse with the music.
```

**The one constraint:** `@Video1` camera style and `@Audio1` rhythm have to be
**temporally compatible**. A slow continuous dolly pulled from a video reference
fighting an EDM track sends the temporal branch conflicting instructions — same
failure class as mixing reference *images* of clashing styles. Pick references
that can coexist. (Sibling of `../higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` § Reference Roles
→ Load-Bearing Rule: references stay in their lanes.)

### Cutting to music — assembling separately-generated clips on one track

`[EMPIRICAL — MiniMax H3 skill corpus, re-derived; cross-model editing craft]`
Beat sync governs what happens *inside* a clip; these three laws govern the
timeline the clips land on:

- **One master track.** The piece binds to a single continuous music track laid
  in post — never per-clip audio stitched end to end. A join in the music is
  audible before a join in the picture is visible.
- **Cuts land on musical punctuation** — a breath, a lyric pause, a snare, the
  drop. Never hard-cut inside a sung vowel unless the incoming shot is an ECU
  whose mouth shape continues that vowel: lip continuity is an *edit*
  constraint, not only a prompt constraint.
- **Mask batch color drift on purpose.** Clips generated in separate runs never
  match grade exactly. One unified fine-grain pass plus one LUT across the whole
  timeline, applied as a deliberate finishing step, hides the inter-clip color
  variance that would otherwise read as a continuity error.

### The `[AUDIO: Xs]` script block — dialogue + SFX + lip-sync from text alone

No microphone, no recording. A timestamped script **inside the prompt text**
generates voices, SFX, and lip-sync. Quoted text → speech with automatic
lip-sync; physical descriptions → sound effects. Each marker is a timestamp in
the clip:

```
[AUDIO: 0s] heavy footsteps on concrete, echoing in a corridor
[AUDIO: 2s] door bursting open, impact bang
[AUDIO: 3s] character says "Nobody move"
[AUDIO: 5s] tense silence, distant traffic
[AUDIO: 7s] character says "Put it down. Slowly."
[AUDIO: 9s] object placed on table, soft thud
```

The model generates the **voice first**, then maps facial movement to the
waveform — so lip-sync quality is mostly set by how precisely you wrote the
dialogue. **Exact quoted text outperforms paraphrase.** It works across
languages (write the line in Spanish/Japanese/French → speech with
phoneme-level lip-sync in that language).

This obeys the same physical rules as § Lip-Sync Rules above: a strong `@Image1`
character reference gives a consistent mouth structure to animate, and **close-up
framing beats wide** (a small face has too few pixels to sync). Keep individual
dialogue beats inside the 3–8s accuracy window.

It **combines with beat sync** in one generation — uploaded music as the
rhythmic foundation, the script block as foreground dialogue/SFX, cuts synced to
the beat:

```
@Audio1 as background music. Sync camera transitions to the beats.
[AUDIO: 0s] music from @Audio1 begins
[AUDIO: 3s] character says "This changes everything"
[AUDIO: 5s] sharp breath — beat drop hits simultaneously
[AUDIO: 8s] character says "Let's go"
```

### The 15-second extraction problem — pick the window, don't upload the track

The audio reference limit is **15s, and the model takes the first 15s** of
whatever you upload. Drop in a full 3-minute track and you almost always feed it
the **intro** — low energy, often ambient, no rhythmic drive. Nothing for the
temporal branch to map.

The right 15s follow a **build → drop** arc: rising tension into a peak. That
dynamic gradient is what becomes visual energy structure. A segment with uniform
energy gives the model beats to detect but **no arc** — output is rhythmically
synced but dramatically flat.

Where the window lives:

- Pre-chorus into chorus
- Instrumental build into the drop (EDM, electronic, hip-hop)
- Verse climax into a bridge
- The last 15s of an intro that breaks into the first hook

**Extract exactly that segment before uploading.** MP3 at **≥256kbps** — lower
bitrate degrades beat detection. Don't upload the full track and hope; pick the
window, cut it, upload that. (Flipping the workflow — audio in first, visuals
built around it — changes the output at a structural level, not subtly.)

## Audio by Model — What Works Best Where

### Kling 3.0 (V3) / 3.0 Omni (O3)
- Best overall audio-visual integration
- Multi-language dialogue (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish + regional accents: American English, British English, Indian English)
- Multi-character dialogue: 3+ characters with correct speaker attribution and lip-sync per character
- Voice Binding: lock specific voice profiles to specific characters across shots
- O3 adds Voice Extraction from static images: upload audio clip (min 3s) + image to build a voice profile
- O3 adds Performance Cloning: act out a scene on camera → AI re-renders preserving likeness and voice
- Include dialogue, ambient, and SFX naturally in the prompt
- Prompt like a script: action + camera + mood + dialogue cues together

**Audio Speaker Attribution Format (V3/O3):**
```
[Speaker: Character Name] "dialogue" in a [warm/confident/excited] [male/female] voice with [accent].
Add [sound: footsteps / rain / door closing] when [action].
Background ambient: [environment description].
```

### Seedance 1.5 Pro
- Best lip-sync accuracy of all models
- Class-leading multilingual support including Chinese dialects
- Most stable emotional tone control
- Use for: professional dialogue scenes, multilingual content

### Seedance 2.0
- Upload MP3 audio as @Audio reference (part of Rule of 12)
- **MP3 only** — WAV/AAC/OGG/FLAC fail silently with no error
- Max 15s per clip, 3 audio files, 10MB each; **≥256kbps** for beat-sync (beat detection)
- **Measured enforcement bounds** `[EMPIRICAL — third-party, China Ark lane, 2026-08]`:
  per-clip duration is enforced at **1.8–15.2s**, and the **total across all attached
  clips is also capped at ≤15.2s** — three individually-legal 6s clips get rejected
  (captured 400 errors). Measured on the China Ark lane by a third party; Higgsfield's
  own proxy enforcement is **unverified** — if a multi-clip attach fails, this total
  cap is the first suspect.
- Timestamp anchoring (audio-as-output): `"Audio @Audio1 plays exactly as uploaded from 0s to end. Do not modify."`
  Then remove all ambient/SFX/music tokens to prevent the generative engine from overriding.
- **`@Audio1` is also a visual driver** — beat sync, the `[AUDIO: Xs]` script block,
  and the first-15s extraction trap are all in § Audio as a Conditioning Input above.

> **Diegetic-only convention for the prompt body** — a
> prompt-authoring discipline that sits on top of Seedance 2.0's
> audio capability. BGM is a valid audio *layer* (see § The Four
> Audio Layers above) — that's what Seedance can generate. The
> diegetic-only convention is what you should *write* in the
> prompt body: only sounds that physically exist in the scene
> (footsteps on wet pavement, fabric whip on motion, breath, room
> tone, weather, weapon fire, crowd reaction, stage haze) rather
> than naming songs, lyrics, or score cues. If music is intended
> for the final cut, layer it in post rather than in the prompt
> body.
>
> Two reasons the discipline matters even though BGM is
> supported: (i) score descriptors ("dramatic strings",
> "orchestral swell") underdetermine the generated audio and
> routinely produce generic music beds at odds with the scene;
> (ii) the *timestamp-anchoring* + *remove-all-music-tokens*
> pattern in the bullets above already enforces this discipline
> when an MP3 audio reference is uploaded — the diegetic-only
> convention generalizes that pattern to all Seedance prompts
> whether or not an audio reference is attached.

### Veo 3 / 3.1
- Strong native audio for English dialogue and environmental sounds
- Dialogue in quotes: `"This must be it," he murmured.`
- SFX explicitly: `tires screeching loudly`
- Ambient as environment soundscape descriptions

### Grok Imagine Video
- Improved audio as of Video Imagine 1.0 (Feb 2026)
- Include audio intent directly in prompt — same inline style as other models
- Best for: social clips where audio adds polish but isn't the hero

## Common Audio Failures and Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Lip-sync completely off | Audio > 8s, or head motion tokens present | Trim to 5s, remove nodding/turning tokens |
| Model replaces uploaded audio | Ambient/music tokens in prompt invite generative override | Add timestamp anchoring phrase, remove all ambient/music tokens |
| Dialogue missing entirely | Non-MP3 format used (Seedance 2.0) | Convert to MP3 128-320kbps |
| SFX drowns out dialogue | Too many SFX cues competing | Reduce to 1-2 SFX per shot, prioritize dialogue |
| Audio sounds robotic | Flat emotional cues | Add emotional direction: "says warmly", "whispers with urgency" |
| Background music too loud | BGM description too prominent in prompt | Move BGM to end of prompt, reduce detail, or say "subtle BGM" |

---

## When to Skip Audio

Not every prompt needs audio direction. Skip audio cues when:
- Using a model without native audio (Kling 2.6, Wan 2.6, Seedance Pro, Minimax Hailuo 2.3/02)
- The content is purely visual (product beauty shots, abstract motion, landscape)
- Audio will be added entirely in post-production
- The prompt is already at the short-form 200-word cap and visual direction is more important

## Cinema Studio 3.0 Audio (Business/Team Plan)

Cinema Studio 3.0 introduces native audio-video joint generation — a fundamental shift from models that treat audio as a post-processing step.

### Native Audio-Video Joint Generation

Audio is generated **simultaneously** with video via a unified multimodal architecture. This means:
- Audio and video are temporally aligned by default — no manual sync needed
- Dual-channel stereo output
- Sound design prompts directly influence both audio AND visual generation
- Audio is not "added on" — it's part of the same generation pass

### Audio as Prompt Element (SCELA)

Always describe audio as a **separate section** in your prompts. The generation engine handles three parallel audio tracks:

1. **BGM** — background music, score
2. **Ambient SFX** — environmental sounds, foley
3. **Dialogue** — character speech, voiceover

```
A chef slices vegetables rapidly on a wooden cutting board.
Camera: tight close-up tracking the knife.
Style: warm kitchen lighting, shallow depth of field.

Audio: rhythmic chopping on wood, oil sizzling in a nearby pan,
soft clinking of ceramic bowls. Light acoustic guitar BGM.
```

### Input Constraints

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Accepted formats | MP3, WAV |
| Max audio clips | 3 per generation |
| Combined duration | ≤15s total |
| Single file size | <15MB |
| MP3 bitrate | 128–320 kbps |

### Lip-Sync

Available but experimental in Cinema Studio 3.0:
- Focus on **emotion and general mouth movement**, not perfect phoneme sync
- **Single face per generation only** — multi-face lip-sync is not supported
- For best results, keep dialogue segments under 8 seconds
- Pair with clear frontal or 3/4 face angle reference images

### Tone / Voice Cloning via @Reference

Control speaking style, accent, and language by referencing a video with the desired voice:

```
Voiceover tone references @Video1. The narrator describes the product
in a warm, conversational tone. "This changes everything."
Audio @Audio1 plays exactly as uploaded from 0s to end.
Do not modify or replace the audio content.
```

### Dialect Support

Dialects written directly in the prompt work — the model understands regional speech patterns. Write dialogue in the target dialect for authentic delivery.

### Timestamp Anchoring

When uploading reference audio that must play unmodified:

```
Audio @Audio1 plays exactly as uploaded from 0s to end.
Do not modify or replace the audio content.
```

Then **remove all ambient/SFX/music tokens** from the prompt to prevent the generation engine from overriding the uploaded audio with generated sound.

### Sound Design Specificity

Describe **specific foley**, not generic moods:

**Wrong:** `nice ambient sounds, pleasant background noise`

**Right:** `the scratch of frosted glass, rustling of plush fabric, gentle tapping on acrylic, popping of bubble wrap, wooden floor creaking under bare feet`

Specific sound descriptions directly influence the generated audio output. The more precise the foley description, the more accurate the result.

## Scene-Audio Generation — Seed Audio 1.0

Separate from in-video joint audio above: **Seed Audio 1.0** (ByteDance, released
2026-06-23 at the FORCE conference) is a standalone **one-pass whole-scene audio
generator**. One generation produces multi-speaker dialogue + music + SFX +
ambience, already mixed — a radio-drama scene, not a single voice track. Use it
to build a soundtrack for footage you'll assemble in post, or scene audio that
has no video at all.

### When to choose it — decision table

| You need | Use | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| A whole scene's soundtrack: several speakers + music + SFX + ambience, mixed in one pass | **Seed Audio 1.0** (`seed_audio`) | One-pass scene audio; script-style prompt drives the whole mix |
| One clean voice track (narration, single-speaker VO) | **`text2speech_v2`** (pick an engine) | Single-voice TTS — simpler, engine-selectable |
| Sound baked into the generated video, synced to on-screen action and lips | **Seedance `generate_audio`** (in-video) | Native joint generation — audio and visuals in the same pass (see § Audio as a Conditioning Input) |

### Verified surface [OFFICIAL — model spec 2026-08-01]

Model id `seed_audio` (output_type `audio`). Parameters:

| Param | Range / options | Default |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| `format` | wav / mp3 / pcm / ogg_opus | wav |
| `sample_rate` | 8000–48000 Hz | 24000 |
| `speech_rate` | −50..100 | 0 |
| `loudness_rate` | −50..100 | 0 |
| `pitch_rate` | −12..+12 | 0 |
| `voice_type` + `voice_id` | preset \| element — **must travel together** | none |

Media roles: `image_references` + `audio_references`. Per the fal schema: up to
**3 reference audio clips** (each ≤30s, ≤10MB) **XOR one image reference** —
image and audio refs cannot combine. Reference audio inputs in the prompt by
load order: `@Audio1`, `@Audio2`, `@Audio3`.

### Script-format prompting [EMPIRICAL — community guides, NOT official docs]

Everything in this subsection is community-converged practice, not spec — treat
as a starting point, not a guarantee. Write the prompt as a **radio-drama
script**:

- Open with a scene header: `[Scene: busy coffee shop, morning]`
- Speaker labels with emotion parentheticals: `Host (warm, upbeat): "…"`
- Inline sound cues where they happen: `[sound: espresso machine, soft jazz fades in]`
- Music by **mood, not genre**: "soft piano builds to triumphant orchestra", not "cinematic score"
- **~4 distinct speakers** is the reliable ceiling
- **Test 20s segments** before scaling toward the ~2-minute cap
- Output **WAV** (`format: wav`) when the audio is headed for post

Compact worked example:

```
[Scene: rain-soaked night market, closing time]
Vendor (tired, warm): "Last skewers — half price, take them."
Girl (excited): "Two! No — three!"
[sound: rain drumming on tarp canopy, a scooter passing in the distance]
Vendor (chuckling): "Three it is. Careful, they're hot."
[sound: coins dropped on a metal tray, charcoal hiss]
Music: a lonely muted trumpet fades in under the rain, wistful but hopeful.
```

## Standalone Audio tab — tool catalog (2026-08-01 snapshot)

The live standalone-audio catalog, reconciled against the models_explore
snapshot of **2026-08-01** (`../../specs/models_explore_snapshot_audio_2026-08-01.json`;
generated table: `../../specs/AUDIO-MODEL-SPECS.md`, machine twin
`../../specs/audio-model-specs.json` — regenerate with `python3 scripts/sync_specs.py --type audio`).
The Audio tab's UI tools — **Voiceover** (text → speech), **Change Voice** (swap a
voice in any video), **Translation** (translate speech in any video) — sit on top
of these models:

| Model id | Name | What it does | Availability |
|----------|------|--------------|--------------|
| `seed_audio` | Seed Audio 1.0 (ByteDance) | One-pass whole-scene audio: dialogue + music + SFX + ambience (§ above) | General |
| `qwen_audio_tts` | Qwen Audio 3.0 TTS Flash (Alibaba) | Expressive TTS: natural-language `instruction` for emotion/dialect/speed, preset or cloned reference-element voices, 13 language hints | General *(NEW 2026-08-01)* |
| `text2speech_v2` | Text to Speech V2 | Single-voice TTS; engine via `variant`: `elevenlabs`, `minimax`, `seed_speech`, `vibe_voice`, **`cozy_voice`** *(NEW)*; preset or reference-element voices (`voice_type` + `voice_id`) | General |
| `sonilo_music` | Sonilo Music (FAL) | Text-to-music with controllable duration | **Game pipeline only** |
| `mirelo_text_to_audio` | Mirelo Text to Audio (FAL) | Text-to-audio SFX with controllable duration | **Game pipeline only** |
| `inworld_text_to_speech` | Inworld TTS (FAL) | Preset-voice TTS, ~110 voices across en/zh/ja/ko/es/fr/de/ru/… | **Game pipeline only** |

Engine picks within `text2speech_v2`: **seed_speech** when the deliverable is
multilingual voiceover/narration; **elevenlabs** (Eleven v3) when fine
emotional/tone control matters; **vibe_voice** for long-form narration. These
are standalone audio generators — distinct from the native joint audio baked
into Kling 3.0 / Seedance 2.0 / Veo during video generation. (Catalog reflects
the 2026-08-01 snapshot; verify live before quoting pricing or availability.)

### Post-generation voice-over — Supercomputer workflow [DEMO]

A post-generation alternative to prompting audio at all: upload the **finished
clip** to Supercomputer and ask for an analyzed voice-over (e.g. "Analyze the
video and create a voiceover for it in the style of wildlife documentaries") —
the agent analyzes the footage, writes a script, and offers voices to pick from.
Shown working in Higgsfield's Seedance-4K tutorial; useful when the visuals are
already locked and only narration is missing.
