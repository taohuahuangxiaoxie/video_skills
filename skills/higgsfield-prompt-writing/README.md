# Higgsfield AI Prompt Skill

A comprehensive Claude skill library for generating high-quality prompts on
[Higgsfield AI](https://higgsfield.ai) — the cinematic video and image generation platform.

## What This Skill Does

Transforms natural language requests into production-ready Higgsfield prompts using:
- The **MCSLA formula** (Model · Camera · Subject · Look · Action)
- Named camera controls and motion presets the platform recognizes
- Model selection guidance across Kling 3.0 / 3.0 Omni / 3.0 Motion Control, Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Wan, Seedance 2.5 / 2.0, FLUX 3 Video, Minimax Hailuo, Higgsfield DoP, and more
- Genre recipe templates for action, horror, romance, sci-fi, product ads, and more
- Soul ID character consistency guidance + Character Sheet creation
- Troubleshooting for failed or poor generations
- **Cinema Studio 2.5** advanced features: Soul Cast AI actors, built-in color grading, 3D Mode (Gaussian Splatting), Grid Generation, Resolution Settings, Frame Extraction Loop, Object & Person Insertion, Per-Character Emotions, Clustering, Five-View Location Reference Sheet, Reference Sheet Types (Motion / Outfit / Palette), Elements System with library surface (5 source tabs × 6 element categories)
- **Cinema Studio 3.0** (Business/Team plan): native dual-channel stereo audio, Smart shot control, 15s max duration, 7 genres, @ reference patterns, Soul Cast 3.0
- **Cinema Studio 3.5**: three-pill main UI (Genre / Style / Camera), Style Settings panel (8 Color Palette / 6 Lighting / 9 Camera Moveset Style + Manual Style mode), Camera Settings four-axis panel (3 Camera Body / 5 Lens / 5 Focal Length including new 75mm / 3 Aperture), Image Mode with four Cinematic models picker (Soul Cinema default, Cinematic Characters, Cinematic Locations, Cinematic Cameras with 2.5 vocabulary)
- **Seedance 2.0 prompting best practices** — Intent over Precision, Genre Router, I2V Gate, Anti-Slop, Physics Language, SCELA audio, Reference-Based / Continuation / Expand Shot / Edit Shot / Transformation prompt modes, Continuation Prompt Formula, the Iteration Rule
- **Seedance 2.5 omni-reference director** — the four generation modes (`t2v` / `omni_reference` / `video_edit` / `video_extension`), explicit `@Image` / `@Video` / `@Audio` reference roles with exclusions, the five-step multi-reference workflow, 30-second staging with end states, timestamp pacing, bracket syntax for music / SFX / dialogue / subtitles, in-prompt first-last-frame and multi-keyframe control, storyboard grids, coarse-vs-fine blockout rendering, one-click video, seamless transitions, and a 2.0-vs-2.5 routing table
- **Hell Grind feature-film pipeline** — Higgsfield's open-sourced 95-minute-feature system: headless character sheets, mask-composited point edits, location sheets with anchors and one light logic, the per-scene GEO SPATIAL LAYOUT block, the position-fixing first second, dialogue construction, the ban dictionary, the 10–15 iteration rule, and the crowd / giant / threshold solutions
- **AI-VFX pipeline** — the production layer under Seedance 2.5, from Higgsfield's AI-vs-VFX challenge build: model routing per asset class (faces / creatures / clothing / locations), the plain-grey sheet law, two-close-up creature sheets, the face-lock crop, the size-ref frame for scale between two subjects, location batching selected on light, the `omni_reference` video-to-video lane (source ≥4s, duration = source) with its performance-inheritance clause, the four-batch stop rule and the i2v fallback with a deliberate empty-frame stitch point, and a slop catalog of the tells that give a shot away
- **Acting director** — performance as behavior under pressure: objective / obstacle / tactics / beats / subtext, listening markers, body + status + proxemics, mandatory eye life, the 150–220-word acting master profile and its per-scene rewrite, the locked voice prompt, a 15-symptom atlas of bad acting, and a 0–5 performance scale
- **GPT Image 2.0 prompt director** — three-format taxonomy (structured JSON for UI mockups / infographics / reference sheets, dense cinematic prose for single-subject scenes, auto-derive meta-prompt for theme-only concepts) plus reference-sheet and static-ad-recreation workflow satellites
- **Higgsfield Canvas** — node-based / infinite-board workspace guidance: chaining prompts → images → videos, named canvas patterns, Shared Canvas live collaboration, build-free / generate-paid cost model
- **Marketing Studio + Content Factory** — 9 DTC ad presets (UGC / Tutorial / Unboxing / Hyper Motion / TV Spot / Wild Card / Virtual Try-On) with 4–15s ad video, plus an end-to-end campaign pipeline (research → plan → generate → publish → report) with a cost-savings report
- **Shared negative constraints reference** — categorized artifacts + prevention phrases (positive alternatives for 3.0); Kling 3.0 Motion Control failure diagnostic; Physics Rendering — Resolution Decision Matrix (cross-model 480p / 720p / 1080p routing rule for Seedance 2.0 + Cinema Studio 3.x)
- **Identity vs. Motion separation** — hard rule for character consistency across shots
- **Annotated templates library** — 10 genre templates with Cinema Studio 3.0 genre mappings, plus Seedance technique + character-design + text-overlay sub-libraries (18 files across 3 categories)
- **DISCIPLINE.md cross-cutting framework** — 9 named discipline patterns in 3-3-3 tier symmetry (prompt-construction, model-selection, iteration-discipline) governing decisions across all sub-skills
- **production-benchmarks.md** — Hell Grind 90-min Cannes feature reference, per-character iteration anchors, acceptance-rate calibration; what "production quality" means in practice
- **FAILURE-MODES.md (Seedance)** — 11 named render failures documented with symptom + mechanism + counter for diagnosis-first iteration
- **C-arc Building Complete AI Projects — 10-Step Methodology** — end-to-end pipeline from idea to delivered project; complements the genre/scene templates
- **Expanded Seedance methodology + Soul refinement** — Iteration Rule + 6-Pass Diagnostic Sequence + Four Questions + Next-Shot Decision Tree + Bridging / Continuation / Repair working modes; Character Anchor Block + Two-Tool Refinement Pipeline for character consistency at production scale

## Install

### Claude Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSideMedia/higgsfield-ai-prompt-skill ~/.claude/skills/higgsfield
```

### Claude Cowork
Drop the repo folder into your Cowork workspace. The skill dispatcher is at `SKILL.md` in the repo root.

### Claude.ai Projects
Upload `SKILL.md` (root) as your project instruction base. Upload files from `skills/` as project documents.

## Higgsfield Stack Integration

This skill is the prompt-construction layer. Higgsfield ships official execution tooling — a CLI, an MCP custom connector, and a bundled skills package. They complement each other: this skill produces the prompt, their tooling executes it. None of their tooling is required for this skill to work — you can always paste prompts directly into higgsfield.ai. But if you want an end-to-end loop, you'll want one of the three.

**A Higgsfield account is required** for any of the tooling below. Sign up at [higgsfield.ai](https://higgsfield.ai).

### Higgsfield CLI

Command-line tool for terminal-native agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor). Per Higgsfield's own guidance, prefer the CLI over the MCP if you're working in a terminal.

- Repo: [github.com/higgsfield-ai/cli](https://github.com/higgsfield-ai/cli)
- Install: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/higgsfield-ai/cli/main/install.sh | sh` or `brew install higgsfield-ai/tap/higgsfield`
- Auth: `higgsfield auth login`

### Higgsfield MCP

Custom connector for claude.ai web and the Claude desktop app. Separate product from the CLI.

- Connector URL: `https://mcp.higgsfield.ai/mcp`
- Install: claude.ai → Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste the URL above → sign in

### Higgsfield Bundled Skills

Markdown skill bundle for agents that consume Cowork-style skills. All three skills drive the CLI under the hood.

- Repo: [github.com/higgsfield-ai/skills](https://github.com/higgsfield-ai/skills)
- Install: `npx skills add higgsfield-ai/skills`
- Skills included: `higgsfield-generate`, `higgsfield-soul`, `higgsfield-product-photoshoot`
- Invoke: `/higgsfield:generate`, `/higgsfield:soul`, `/higgsfield:product-photoshoot`

### End-to-end example

How the layers fit together for a real request:

```
USER:    "Make me a cinematic chase scene through a night market.
          Use my trained Soul character — reference_id abc123."
   ↓
THIS SKILL — higgsfield-ai-prompt-skill
   • routes to higgsfield-prompt + higgsfield-camera + higgsfield-soul
   • picks Kling 3.0 (character-focused, supports --soul-id)
   • applies MCSLA: model, camera preset, subject, look, action
   • appends shared negative constraints
   • outputs a production-grade Higgsfield prompt
   ↓
PRE-FLIGHT (optional, recommended for Veo / Kling / Sora / Seedance video):

   SCHEMA VERIFY (recommended for any model you haven't called recently):
   CLI path:        higgsfield model get kling3_0
                    → returns schema: aspect_ratio enum, duration range,
                      mode/sound options, media roles
   MCP path:        models_explore(action="get", model_id="kling3_0")
                    → returns same schema as CLI

   COST ESTIMATE (no job submitted):
   MCP path:        generate_video(..., get_cost: true)
                    → returns credit cost + adjustments block

   CLI path:        higgsfield generate cost kling3_0 \
                      --prompt "<prompt from this skill>" \
                      --aspect_ratio 16:9 \
                      --duration 8
                    # (add reference flags as needed: --soul-id, --start-image,
                    #  --end-image — consult `higgsfield model get kling3_0`
                    #  for supported media roles)

   Bundled skills:  drop to CLI for the cost check (same auth, same workspace),
                    then invoke /higgsfield:generate

   Optional account checks (same data across surfaces):
   MCP path:        balance / transactions tools
   CLI path:        higgsfield account status
                    higgsfield account transactions --size 50

   Note: 2.35:1 is anamorphic STYLE vocabulary, not a valid Kling 3.0 output
         ratio. Output ratios are platform-bounded: 16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1 only.
   ↓
HIGGSFIELD STACK — one of three execution surfaces:

   CLI path:
     higgsfield generate create kling3_0 \
       --prompt "<prompt from this skill>" \
       --aspect_ratio 16:9 \
       --duration 8 \
       --wait
     # (add reference flags as needed: --soul-id, --start-image, --end-image —
     #  consult `higgsfield model get kling3_0` for supported media roles)

   Bundled skills path:
     /higgsfield:generate — takes the prompt as its --prompt argument,
     formats the CLI call above under the hood

   MCP path (claude.ai web/desktop):
     Claude invokes the Higgsfield connector with the prompt as input
   ↓
USER:    Result URL returned. Iterate if needed (this skill's
         iteration discipline applies regardless of execution surface).
```

The layer split holds in every case: this skill always produces the prompt, the Higgsfield stack always handles the generation call. None of the three execution paths reach back into prompt construction; this skill never shells out to their CLI or API.

> Full preflight discipline — when to surface it, marketing-studio caveat, CLI naming gotchas (`account status`, not `balance`), and the plan-tier-vs-surface framing — lives in [`skills/higgsfield-stack/SKILL.md`](skills/higgsfield-stack/SKILL.md) § Preflight discipline.

## Generation Ledger

Every generation attempt — kept, rejected, or filter-flagged — gets one row in
`db/ledger/<project>.json`, logged by the agent in ≤5 seconds (one question,
one command — never a form). After ~30–40 rows a production has empirical
takes-per-kept ratios per shot type instead of vibes:

```bash
python3 scripts/higgsfield_memory.py log-gen adze --model seedance_2_0 \
  --tags dialogue-cu,two-char --outcome rejected --reason extra-cuts
python3 scripts/higgsfield_memory.py ratio adze --credits     # hit rates + money view
python3 scripts/higgsfield_memory.py budget adze --shots plan.json   # price before burning
```

Tags and reject reasons come from controlled vocabularies (`db/ledger/README.md`);
rows are append-only with superseding corrections; `ratio` splits structural vs
stochastic rejections and flags `low-n` rows instead of faking precision.

## Maintenance — two activation steps

Two capabilities ship **inactive on purpose** and need a one-time setup.

### 1. Activate the scheduled spec-drift check

`.github/workflows/spec-drift.yml` runs `scripts/refresh_specs.py` weekly to catch when
Higgsfield changes a model's lineup or capabilities before the 30-day staleness
warning would. It ships **dormant** until you give it the Higgsfield CLI
credentials as a repo secret:

```bash
higgsfield auth login                 # if not already authenticated locally
gh secret set HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS < ~/.config/higgsfield/credentials.json
```

Then run it once manually (Actions tab → **spec-drift** → *Run workflow*) to
confirm the CLI-install step resolves on the runner. After that it's automatic:
**fresh** → nothing; **drift** → it opens/updates a GitHub issue with next steps;
**auth expired** → the job fails so GitHub notifies you to re-run
`higgsfield auth login` and refresh the secret. The credentials live only in the
GitHub secret — they are never committed.

### 2. Let routing telemetry accumulate before pruning

`log-route` / `routing` (in `scripts/higgsfield_memory.py`) record which sub-skills each
request opens, so "which skills are load-bearing, which to retire" becomes a
data question:

```bash
python3 scripts/higgsfield_memory.py log-route --skills higgsfield-prompt,higgsfield-camera
python3 scripts/higgsfield_memory.py routing     # ranks opens, lists the never-opened tail
```

This is **instrumentation, not a verdict** — let real requests accumulate before
acting on the tail. A small sample is not evidence a skill is dead.

## Example Prompts

**Basic:**
> "Write me a Higgsfield prompt for a cinematic action chase through a night market"

**Specific:**
> "I need a horror prompt using VHS style, Dutch angle camera, and the Horror Face preset"

**With reference:**
> "I have a Soul ID character. Write 3 different scene prompts with her — office, party, rooftop"

**Model question:**
> "Should I use Kling 3.0 or Sora 2 for a large-scale battle scene?"

**Troubleshoot:**
> "My image-to-video isn't animating, it's just static. What am I doing wrong?"

## The MCSLA Formula

| Letter | Layer | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| M | Model | Kling 3.0 |
| C | Camera | FPV Drone weaving through the alley |
| S | Subject | A woman in a tactical jacket |
| L | Look | Cinematic, cold blue shadows, 16:9 |
| A | Action | She sprints, slides under a gate |
