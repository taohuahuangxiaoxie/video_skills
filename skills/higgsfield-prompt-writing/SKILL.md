# Higgsfield AI Prompt Skill

## Local scope boundary (highest priority)

- This installed skill is **prompt-writing only**. It may write, rewrite, diagnose, review, and save prompt text or prompt-specific analysis.
- Route only to prompt, camera, acting, facial-expression, shot-structure, and negative-constraint guidance needed for the requested text.
- Do not route to workspaces, model selection, product support, assistants, stacks, generation execution, ledgers, uploads, CLI/MCP/API operations, browser control, ComfyUI control, or file relocation.
- When the target is not Higgsfield, use only transferable filmmaking craft. The target model's official schema and syntax take priority over Higgsfield-specific MCSLA, presets, `@` references, or facial-action-unit codes.
- Never insert platform-specific syntax unless the target model explicitly supports it.
- For human images and wardrobe/dance prompts, use `skills/higgsfield-facs/SKILL.md` local defaults: facial identity stays stable, hairstyles may differ per look, and expressions rise and release across cuts rather than staying in one smile. Read its wardrobe/performance reference when set-level consistency matters.

**Language rule:** Reply in whatever language the user writes in.

## HARD RULES — pre-delivery checklist

These rules apply to every Higgsfield response. They are written as a pre-delivery checklist the agent runs *before* sending the response, not as prohibitions stated and then forgotten. The failure mode they prevent is **plausibility-over-verification** — producing a response that looks correct because the agent's training data knows the rough shape of Higgsfield work, rather than because the agent actually read the skill files and verified the platform's ground truth.

**Before delivering any Higgsfield response, confirm in this order:**

1. **Routing line present.** First line of response names which sub-skills you routed to (e.g. "Routing to higgsfield-prompt + higgsfield-camera for an Atmosphere push-in"). One line, then the work. Missing routing line = response is incomplete; add it.

2. **Routed sub-skills opened and read in this conversation.** Match the user's ask to the routing table below, open the matching sub-skill files with the read tool, and READ them. Root `SKILL.md` and `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` are mandatory at minimum on any prompt request. Grepped snippets do not satisfy this rule. Full reads do. If your only access to root `SKILL.md` or `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` in this conversation came from grep results, you have not satisfied this rule — open the file. Platform vocabulary, preset names, and model parameters must come from the files because this platform's lineup changes between releases.

3. **Named vocabulary verified, not invented.** Camera preset names, motion preset names, model names, CLI flag forms, and MCP tool parameter names all come from the skill files or from verification. For model parameters, enums, and durations, verify against `specs/model-specs.yaml` first — it is generated from a dated `models_explore` snapshot (see `snapshot_date` inside the file); if the snapshot is stale (>30 days), verify live instead (`higgsfield model get <model>` for CLI param schemas; `models_explore` for MCP). If you found yourself thinking "this flag probably looks like X" or "this preset is probably called Y" — stop. Read the file or run the verification command. Plausibility is not validity. Do not substitute generic video-prompt vocabulary for named Higgsfield presets; do not invent model versions, camera presets, or motion-preset names. If the user names one you don't see in the skill files, say so and ask for clarification.

4. **MCSLA structure intact on video prompts.** Model · Camera · Subject · Look · Action. Five layers, every video prompt, unless the user explicitly opted out.

5. **Shared negative constraints appended.** Pull positive-phrasing prevention phrases from `skills/shared/negative-constraints.md`. Do not paraphrase from training; use the exact phrasing from the file. (Kling 3.0 prefers positive phrasing over negations; using negation-form constraints when the file says positive is a fidelity miss.)

6. **Preflight surfaced when applicable.** If execution intent is signaled (CLI / MCP / bundled-skills mentioned) AND a video-class or high-cost model is named OR a budget concern is named, surface the two-step preflight (`model get` / `models_explore` for schema, then cost estimate). See `skills/higgsfield-stack/SKILL.md` § Preflight discipline.

7. **Aspect ratio is an enum, not a free-form value.** Check the model's allowed ratios against `specs/model-specs.yaml` before writing them into the header; if the snapshot is stale (>30 days), verify live via schema (`models_explore` / `model get`). Example of why this matters: Seedance 2.0 supports native 21:9, Kling 3.0 does not. Anamorphic / 2.35:1 / 2.39:1 are *style register* vocabulary for the Look line, not output ratios. See `vocab.md` § Aspect Ratio: output spec vs. style register.

8. **Prompt under 200 words — short-form regime only.** Soft cap from MCSLA section. Going over is a signal you're padding rather than locking — tighten. **Regime exception:** block-scaffold production prompts (`skills/higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` § Official Prompt Architecture) replace the word cap with structural lint — harvested production Seedance briefs run 218–2,059-word medians depending on register `[FIELD — 13-project community harvest, 2026-07-18]`. The cap governs single-shot MCSLA prompts; a block-scaffold prompt over 200 words is not a rule-8 violation.

**If any of items 1–8 are missing or unverified, the response is incomplete. Complete them before sending, not after.**

## What Is Higgsfield?

Higgsfield is a cinematic AI video and image generation platform built for filmmakers and
creators. Unlike single-model tools, Higgsfield hosts **multiple generation engines** on one
platform — Kling 3.0/3.0 Omni/3.0 Motion Control, Sora 2 incl. Pro/Max/Pro Max tiers (UI-only — confirmed in the UI 2026-07-06, absent from the API/MCP catalog), Google Veo 3.1/3.1 Lite, Wan 2.7/2.6/2.5,
Seedance 2.5/2.0/Pro, FLUX 3 Video, Minimax Hailuo 2.3/02, Higgsfield DoP (Lite/Standard/Turbo) for video; Soul 2.0, Soul Cinema Preview,
Soul Cast, Nano Banana Pro/2, Kling Image 3.0/Omni, Seedream 4.0, GPT Image 2.0,
Flux 2/Kontext for images — plus a library of 100+ named **Motion Presets**, a **Soul ID**
character consistency system, **Cinema Studio 2.5**, **Cinema Studio 3.0** (Business/Team plan), and **Cinema Studio 3.5** with Soul Cast AI actors, native dual-channel stereo audio, and 80+
one-click **Apps**.

## Working Folders — file handling

The project has a `workspace/` folder with three subfolders. Use them for every
task that involves a user-provided document or a file you produce. This keeps
uploads and deliverables out of the project root.

| Folder | Role | Your behavior |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `workspace/input/` | Documents the user wants you to read (scripts, story bibles, briefs, character sheets, references). | Read from here first. If the user uploaded a file that landed elsewhere in the project root, **move it into `workspace/input/` before working with it**. When you need a document from the user, ask them to drop it in `workspace/input/`. |
| `workspace/output/` | Files you generate for the user (prompt packs, shot breakdowns, batch CSVs, reports, exported docs). | **Write every file deliverable here**, not to the project root. Tell the user the path when you finish. |
| `workspace/processed/` | Inputs you have finished consuming. | When a task is complete, **move the source from `input/` to `processed/`** so `input/` stays clean. Never delete the user's files — relocate them. |

Rules:
- Never scatter user uploads or generated files across the project root or skill folders — route them through `workspace/`.
- Treat `workspace/input/` as the canonical place to look when the user says "the script / bible / reference I gave you."
- These three folders' contents are local-only (git-ignored); do not assume anything in them is committed.

### Fast Path — Simple Creative Requests

If the user provides a clear creative intent ("write me a prompt for a car chase at night")
with no specific constraints, **generate immediately** using these sensible defaults:

> **Fast Path still requires reading `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` first — Fast Path means skip clarifying questions, NOT skip the file read.**

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Aspect ratio | 16:9 |
| Duration | 8s (Kling lanes — see Seedance exception below) |
| Style | Cinematic |
| Video model | Kling 3.0 (character-focused) or Seedance 2.0 (action/scale/references) |
| Image model | Soul 2.0 (portrait) or Nano Banana 2 (everything else) |

Do not ask clarifying questions. Deliver a ready-to-paste prompt. Mention the defaults
used so the user can adjust if they want something different.

> **Seedance exception:** Seedance 2.0 never gets a silently defaulted runtime
> (`skills/higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` — always ask, never default). On Fast
> Path that means: if the user named no duration, route video to Kling 3.0;
> pick Seedance 2.0 only when the request names a duration — or when the user
> asked for Seedance by name, in which case state the assumed runtime as the
> first adjustable default in the delivery.

> If you did not read `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` earlier in this conversation, read it now before writing the prompt.

### Full Path — Production Requests

When the user signals production-grade intent (Cinema Studio, multi-shot, specific model,
budget constraints, client work), **confirm before generating:**

**Required:**
- **Generation type**: Image / Video / App (one-click)
- **Video duration**: model-dependent enum — check the model's `duration` values in `specs/model-specs.yaml` before offering choices (e.g. Seedance 2.0 4–15s, Veo 3.1 4/6/8s; image-to-video clips trend short)
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1 / 4:5 / 4:3 / 21:9-where-supported (default: 16:9) — enums per model in `specs/model-specs.yaml` (HARD RULE 7); anamorphic / 2.35:1 / 2.39:1 are **Look-line style register**, never output ratios
- **Model preference** (or ask Claude to recommend — see `skills/higgsfield-models/SKILL.md`)

**Optional (skip if user already provided):**
- Visual style: Cinematic / VHS / Super 8MM / Anamorphic / Abstract
- Soul ID character reference (if character consistency needed)
- Reference image for image-to-video
- Motion preset preference

> Ask everything in one message — do not split across multiple rounds.

| Animated AD / brand promo as an **AI-generated video** built brief → storyboard sheet → Seedance ("make a motion", "motion design ad", "animate my logo into a video", "promo/ad video", classicMD/highMD) | `higgsfield-motion-design` |
| **Vibe Motion vs Motion Design** (both say "motion graphics / brand / logo animation"): want **crisp text, exact colors, deployable code, editable canvas** → `higgsfield-vibe-motion` (Remotion code); want a **cinematic/kinetic AI video clip** (pixel render, native audio, no guaranteed-crisp text) → `higgsfield-motion-design` (Seedance). When unsure, ask "should the text/logo stay perfectly crisp and editable (code), or is this a rendered video clip?" | — |

| **Replace a VFX/3D pipeline with generation** — "can AI do this instead of VFX", put myself in this plate, put a creature in my footage, a dragon/monster shot without buying or rigging a 3D model, "how do I build a whole VFX shot", asset sheets → size-ref → locations → shots as one pipeline; also "my v2v keeps failing / turns to slop", scale drift between two subjects, which image model for faces vs creatures vs clothing vs locations | `higgsfield-seedance-2-5` (`VFX-PIPELINE.md`) |

### Load Map — how much to read

The routing table says *where*; this says *how much*. Loads are cumulative — every path starts from HARD RULE 2's mandatory reads.

| Situation | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Simple creative prompt (Fast Path) | root `SKILL.md` + `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` — nothing else |
| Any Seedance prompt | + `skills/higgsfield-seedance/SKILL.md` (+ the matching `templates/seedance/` file when the request is technique-shaped) |
| Multi-scene / sequence / script breakdown | + `higgsfield-shotlist-director` + `higgsfield-pipeline` |
| Model choice unclear or contested | + `higgsfield-models` + `specs/` (the generated spec for the output type) |
| User reports a generation result | + `higgsfield-recall` (ledger write) |
| Budget / credits / plan question | + `higgsfield-assist` |
| Anything else | one routing-table row → that sub-skill; resist loading more than the row names |

### Check Templates for Genre Match

Before writing a prompt from scratch, check if the user's request matches a common genre
pattern. The `templates/` folder contains 10 annotated example templates with line-by-line
breakdowns, recommended models, negative constraints, and variations.

| User request matches | Check template |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Chase, pursuit, action, parkour | `templates/01-cinematic-action-chase.md` |
| Product, commercial, ad, UGC | `templates/02-product-ugc-showcase.md` |
| Horror, scary, creepy, dread | `templates/03-horror-atmosphere.md` |
| Fashion, editorial, lookbook | `templates/04-fashion-editorial.md` |
| Sci-fi, cyberpunk, VFX, space | `templates/05-sci-fi-vfx.md` |
| Portrait, character intro, close-up | `templates/06-portrait-character-intro.md` |
| Landscape, nature, establishing shot | `templates/07-landscape-establishing-shot.md` |
| Comedy, social media, TikTok, skit | `templates/08-comedy-social-media.md` |
| Romance, intimate, couple, wedding | `templates/09-romantic-intimate.md` |
| Dance, music, performance, concert | `templates/10-dance-music-performance.md` |

Use the template as a starting point — adapt the example prompt to the user's specific
request. The annotations explain WHY each element works, helping you make informed
substitutions.

**Technique templates** (`templates/seedance/`) — structure templates for Seedance
prompts where the user request is technique-shaped rather than genre-shaped:

| Technique need | Template |
|---|---|
| Pre-visualize multi-character spatial geometry before prompting | `templates/seedance/top-down-map.md` |
| Multi-character shot with cross-character relationships | `templates/seedance/multi-character-anchor.md` |
| Single-character shot with position + pose + contact-point locks | `templates/seedance/single-character-position.md` |
| Worked example: two-character anchoring end-to-end | `templates/seedance/worked-example-two-character.md` |
| Anime / stylized-2D animation — layered formula + style block + character turnaround | `templates/seedance/anime-animation.md` |
| Close-up facial acting via FACS Action Unit codes — beat-synced expression schedule | `templates/seedance/facs-expression-beats.md` |
| Seedance **2.5** multi-reference brief — role map + staged beats with end states | `templates/seedance/omni-reference-2-5.md` |

**Text-overlay templates** (`templates/text-overlays/`) — paste-ready text-rendering
prompts for slogan / subtitle / speech-bubble overlays:

| Text overlay type | Template |
|---|---|
| Slogan / brand callout / opening title | `templates/text-overlays/slogan.md` |
| Subtitle (dialogue-synchronized) | `templates/text-overlays/subtitle.md` |
| Speech bubble (character-attributed) | `templates/text-overlays/speech-bubble.md` |

### Build the Prompt Using the MCSLA Formula

Full MCSLA definition and prompt structure → `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md`

Quick summary — five layers, every prompt:

| M | C | S | L | A |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model | Camera | Subject | Look | Action |

**Core rules:**
- Be specific — name camera presets, describe VFX concretely
- Keep prompts under 200 words (short-form regime — block-scaffold production prompts follow their own structural rules, HARD RULE 8)
- Subject → Action → Camera → Style is the most reliable order

---

### Output Format

**Single prompt:**
```
**Model**: [model name]
**Aspect ratio**: [ratio]  **Duration**: [Xs]  **Style**: [style]

[Prompt]

**Camera**: [camera control name]
**Motion preset** (if used): [preset name]
```

**Two versions (when style varies):**
```
### Version 1 — [Style Name]
[Prompt]

---
### Version 2 — [Style Name]
[Prompt]
```

**Output rules:**
- Output a clean, ready-to-paste prompt — no meta-commentary after
- Do not explain what every line does unless the user asks
- Always name the camera control and motion preset explicitly

---

## Generation Ledger — log every result

Every generation attempt the user reports — kept, rejected, or filter-flagged —
gets one row in `db/ledger/<project>.json`. The denominator (successes too,
not just failures) is what turns the memory system into takes-per-kept ratios
and credit budgets.

**The 5-second rule:** when the user reports a result, ask at most ONE
question ("keep or reject — what failed?") and write the row yourself with
one `scripts/higgsfield_memory.py log-gen` command. Never ask twice; never present a
form. Full workflow: `skills/higgsfield-recall/SKILL.md` § Log the Generation
Result. Ratios and budgeting: `skills/higgsfield-assist/SKILL.md`.

---

## @ Reference Rules

- User uploads a document (script, bible, brief, reference notes): read it from `workspace/input/`; if it landed elsewhere, move it there first (see Working Folders above)
- User uploads image: use `[reference image]` or describe it as "the provided reference"
- For Soul ID character: note "using Soul ID character reference" in the prompt
- For video extension: note "extend from [reference video], continue with..."
- For style transfer: note "match the visual style of [reference image]"

---

## Shared Resources

| Resource | What it contains | When to use |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `skills/shared/negative-constraints.md` | All generation artifacts + prevention phrases, by category | Check before every prompt — append relevant constraints |
| `templates/` | 10 annotated genre templates with examples, models, annotations, variations | When user request matches a common genre — use as starting point |
| `templates/ad-asset-prep.md` | Ad asset preparation: product sheets, hero-character sheets, location plates — generate-many → test-in-motion → lock-the-winner | When an ad/product request needs reference assets built before video |
| `templates/character-design/` | 6 character-design worksheets (9-question sheet, story bible, visual DNA) | With `higgsfield-character-design` when developing characters before prompting |
| `templates/seedance/` | 9 Seedance technique templates: top-down-map, multi-character-anchor, single-character-position, worked-example-two-character, anime-animation, facs-expression-beats, footage-vfx-transform, global-style-prefix, omni-reference-2-5 | When Seedance request is technique-shaped (spatial blocking, multi-character anchoring, anime/stylized-2D, FACS acting, footage VFX, style prefix, 2.5 multi-reference) |
| `templates/text-overlays/` | 3 text-rendering templates: slogan, subtitle, speech-bubble | When user request includes on-screen text rendering |
